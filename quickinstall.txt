Running php-irc consists of 6 general steps (EXPERTS ONLY!):

1) Download and unpack, compile the php 5 5.0.2+ package with sockets and pcntl.
2) Edit the php.ini file following the steps in section 3-b (bottom half of section under "First, locate this line in the file:")
3) Unzip php irc
4) If the bot does not start up and connect to the server, you may have to set the OS parameter in the defines.php file.  Read the previous section.
5) Change server/port information in bot.conf.  You can run php-irc with the -c switch to get an md5 password hash to set dccadminpass with.
6) run php-irc with: /path/to/php/php.exe bot.php bot.conf from the php-irc directory, or edit the shebang line and change it to reflect your php location, (also use -c switch to specify php.ini location), and then chmod the bot.php file 755, and run with ./bot.php bot.conf

Of course, I recommend that you read the rest of this file, as it provides some very important information.
